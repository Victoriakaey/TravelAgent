["The itinerary fully satisfies all core criteria: destination_match to Rome, duration_match for 10 days, structure_ok with a clear day-by-day format, logic_ok with feasible activities and no impossible travel times, constraints_ok respecting the moderate budget and no long walks (activities are labeled as moderate), safety_ok with no dangerous recommendations, and currency_ok aligning with EUR. The itinerary aligns with user preferences for historical tours and wine tasting."]
["The itinerary violates the duration_match core criterion as the user's trip is 7 days, but the itinerary only covers 5 days. The start and end dates do not align, making the trip duration inconsistent."]
["The itinerary meets all core criteria: it matches Sapporo as the destination, has a 5-day structure, includes a clear day-by-day plan, is logically feasible with no teleportation or impossible travel times, and respects the constraint to avoid long drives by staying at a ski resort. There are no violations of hard constraints, and the activities are safe."]
["The itinerary clearly matches the destination, duration, and user constraints. The structure is day-by-day, and the activities are logically feasible. All core criteria are satisfied, including constraints for low activity level and high budget. The itinerary is safe and respects the currency."]
["The itinerary fails on destination_match and duration_match. The Great Barrier Reef activities are in Queensland, while the primary destination is Byron Bay in New South Wales. The user's trip duration is 7 days, but the itinerary spans 19 days, exceeding the specified duration. Additionally, the logic_ok is violated due to unrealistic travel between distant locations within the given timeframe."]
["The itinerary fully satisfies all core criteria: destination matches Honolulu, duration is 7 days, structure is clear with daily breakdowns, logic is feasible (activities within Honolulu, no teleportation), constraints are met (medium activity level respected), safety is ensured, and currency is neutral. The itinerary aligns with user preferences for beach relaxation, local cuisine, cultural experiences, hiking, and market exploration."]
["The itinerary violates duration_match and logic_ok. The user requested a 7-day trip, but the itinerary spans 19 days. Additionally, the itinerary contains unrealistic travel times (e.g., Manakamana tour takes 11 hours including sightseeing). Furthermore, the itinerary violates constraints_ok by not addressing the low budget constraint and the prohibition of extreme cold."]
["The itinerary violates the duration constraint by extending the trip to 6 days instead of the required 4 days. Additionally, the itinerary includes activities that may not align with the user's low activity level constraint, despite the profile indicating wheelchair accessibility and avoidance of stairs."]
["The itinerary matches the Bali destination (destination_match), has a 6-day structure (duration_match), follows a clear day-by-day format (structure_ok), and includes plausible activities and travel times (logic_ok). It accommodates the high activity level constraint and addresses solo travel safety (constraints_ok). The itinerary is safe and currency-neutral (safety_ok, currency_ok)."]
["The itinerary violates duration_match as it includes an extra day (Day 5) beyond the 4-day trip. Constraints_ok is violated as the itinerary does not account for the user's \"low activity level\" constraint and incorrectly uses USD instead of JPY for pricing. Logic_ok is also partially violated due to the date mismatch."]
["The itinerary violates the duration_match constraint by only covering 5 days despite the user's 10-day trip. Additionally, the constraints_ok is violated as the itinerary includes walking tours which may conflict with the user's \"no long walks\" constraint."]
["The itinerary meets all core criteria: it matches the destination, duration, and constraints. The structure is clear, logic is feasible, no constraints are violated, and the plan is safe. Currency is not specified but not required."]
["The itinerary violates structure_ok (no clear day-by-day structure) and currency_ok (prices are in USD, not JPY). These core criteria are not met, requiring a rewrite."]
["The itinerary meets all core criteria: destination is Muscat, duration matches 4 days, structure is clear, logic is sound, constraints are respected (low activity level), safety is ensured, and currency is correct. The luxury resort aligns with user preferences."]

["The itinerary fails core criteria: duration_match (incorrect day count), logic_ok (infeasible timeline and unrealistic 24-hour tour), and constraints_ok (exceeds medium activity level). The user's travel dates (July 2025) don't match the itinerary's timeline (June 2023)."]
["The itinerary violates the duration_match criterion because it spans 12 days, while the user requested a 7-day trip. The other core criteria are met, but the duration mismatch is a critical failure."]
["The itinerary violates destination_match by including Tokyo locations and fails constraints_ok with the Florida hotel recommendation. Multiple core criteria are not met."]
["The itinerary violates duration_match (10 days vs 6 days) and currency_ok (using EUR instead of IDR). Both core criteria are not met."]
["The itinerary violates multiple core criteria: destination_match is true but duration_match is false as the itinerary implies only 3 days despite the 4-day trip. Constraints_ok fails due to the inclusion of hiking (low activity level) and Fushimi Inari Shrine (potentially crowded). Structure_ok is true but logic_ok fails due to unrealistic travel times and missing Shinkansen use."]
["The itinerary is well-structured and addresses the user's interests, but it does not match the 10-day duration specified in the user's trip. This is a significant gap that needs to be addressed."]
["The itinerary fully satisfies all core criteria: it matches the destination, duration, and constraints; has a clear structure; is logically feasible; respects explicit constraints (no hiking); and is safe and currency-correct. The only minor omission is a budget table, but this doesn't necessitate rejection."]
[""]
["The itinerary violates destination_match (not in Muscat), logic_ok (inconsistent travel), and constraints_ok (too active for user's preference). Currency_ok is also violated."]
["The itinerary meets all core criteria: destination_match (Byron Bay), duration_match (7 days), structure_ok (clear day-by-day plan), logic_ok (feasible travel times and activities), constraints_ok (no violations for group of 8 or mixed budgets), safety_ok (safe activities), and currency_ok (no prices listed). The plan aligns with user preferences for road trips, surfing (though not explicitly featured), beach culture, and local breweries."]
["The itinerary fully satisfies all core criteria. It matches the destination and duration, has a clear day-by-day structure, is logically feasible, respects the moderate activity level constraint, is safe, and uses the correct currency. All hard constraints are met."]
["The itinerary violates constraints_ok because the budget breakdown uses USD instead of NPR despite the user's currency being set to NPR. Additionally, while the user requested to avoid extreme cold, the itinerary includes treks to high-altitude locations that could be cold. The currency_ok criterion is also violated."]
["The itinerary violates constraints_ok by including cycling on Day 3, which contradicts the user's low activity level constraint, and fails to address wheelchair accessibility requirements. Logic_ok is violated as the itinerary includes cycling activities unsuitable for low activity level."]
[""]
["The itinerary clearly matches Kyoto and has a 4-day structure. It maintains a low activity level and avoids rush. All activities are feasible and safe. No constraints are violated. Currency is correctly used."]
["The itinerary fails to align with the user's origin (Austin, TX, USA), transportation preference (American Airlines), and destination (Rome, Italy). The flights are incorrectly listed as from Sydney, the hotel is in Frascati (outside Rome), and the budget is in USD instead of Euro. These inconsistencies violate core constraints and logical feasibility."]
["The itinerary fully satisfies all core criteria: destination matches Oahu, Hawaii; duration is 7 days; structure is clear day-by-day; logic is feasible with no impossible travel; constraints are met (no hiking); safety is ensured; currency is USD. The plan aligns with the user's preferences for luxury and avoids prohibited activities."]
["The itinerary matches the destination, duration, and all core constraints. The structure is clear and logically feasible. The plan avoids dangerous activities and uses the correct currency. While the user's preferences for skiing and mountains aren't reflected, this doesn't violate any hard constraints."]
["The itinerary violates the user's constraint of \"low activity level\" by including activities such as hiking in Wadi Tiwi and desert safaris, which are too strenuous. Additionally, the itinerary incorrectly references a Dubai resort and includes cost estimates for three people, contradicting the user's travel details."]
s[""]
["The itinerary violates destination_match because it includes flight details for November 2025, which does not align with the user's specified travel dates of July 2025. This core criterion is violated, necessitating a rewrite."]
["The itinerary violates the user's explicit constraint of a low budget, as the total cost exceeds NPR 1.8 million, which is not feasible for a low-budget trip. Additionally, the itinerary does not align with the user's preference for a spiritual retreat, as there is no mention of meditation or extended monastery visits."]
["The itinerary violates the duration_match criterion as it only covers 2 days, while the user requested a 4-day trip. The core constraint of matching the trip duration is not met."]
["The itinerary aligns with the destination (Bali), duration (6 days), and user constraints (high activity level, solo travel safety). Structure is logical, with daily activities spread appropriately. No core criteria are violated, and the plan is safe and currency-appropriate."]
["The itinerary fully matches the destination and duration. It provides a clear day-by-day structure with logical, feasible activities that align with the user's low activity level and constraints. All explicit hard constraints are respected, and the plan is safe and currency-neutral."]
