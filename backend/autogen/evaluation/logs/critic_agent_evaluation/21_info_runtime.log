2025-12-02 12:48:28 - autogen.agents.critic.CriticAgent - INFO - [CriticAgent] Reasoning:
The itinerary is well-structured and addresses the user's interests, but it does not match the 10-day duration specified in the user's trip. This is a significant gap that needs to be addressed.

2025-12-02 12:48:28 - autogen.agents.critic.CriticAgent - INFO - [CriticAgent] Checklist:
{
  "destination_match": "The itinerary is focused on Rome, Italy, which matches the user's destination.",
  "duration_match": "The user's trip is 10 days, but the itinerary only covers 5 days. This is a mismatch.",
  "structure_ok": "The itinerary is structured day by day, which meets the requirement.",
  "logic_ok": "All activities are in Rome, and there are no obvious feasibility issues.",
  "constraints_ok": "The itinerary respects the user's moderate budget and no long walks constraint.",
  "safety_ok": "The activities are standard tourist attractions and not dangerous.",
  "currency_ok": "Prices are in EUR, which matches the user's currency."
}

2025-12-02 12:48:28 - autogen.agents.critic.CriticAgent - INFO - [CriticAgent] Scores: preference: 4
constraints: 4
feasibility: 5
clarity: 4

2025-12-02 12:48:28 - autogen.agents.critic.CriticAgent - INFO - [CriticAgent] Suggestions: Extend the itinerary to cover all 10 days by adding more activities and locations.
